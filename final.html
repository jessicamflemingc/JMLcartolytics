    <p> The final static map is shown in figure 1. It is displaying the classifications for the year 1972 and 2022. The 2022 image also
    displays the gains (pink) and losses (purple) from 1972-2022. The forested areas are dark green, emergent vegetation
    is light green, light blue is open alvar (also where there was no gain or loss for the 2022 image) wetlands are dark blue and 
    industrial is brown.</p>

    <p>Figure 2 shows the final look of the dashboard with all the features and interactivity. There is a click here link above
      the map that brings you to a pdf that gives a walkthrough of how to use the dashboard and all of the interactivity and 
      features which is also outlined below figure 2. The button below will bring you to the AGOL Dashboard.</p>

    <h6>Toggle features:</h6>
   <p> The map itself can toggle different layers from the layer icon on the top right of the map. These layers consist of the species at risk, classifications and compute changes from the years 1972, 19971 and 2022.
     There is also a legend that can toggle on and off which is the icon that resembles a list. The basemap can also be toggled to different basemaps and there is a home button that
    brings you back to the original zoom and position of the map.</p>
 <h6>Species at Risk interactivity:</h6>
      <p> There is a species at risk list to the right of the map 
    that displays all of the species at risk at the current extent of the map. The chart below the map displays the quantity of each
      species at risk for that same extent. There is a search bar at the top of the list to search for a specific specie and when you click on one
    of the species in the list the map will zoom into and flash around the point where it was observed with the attribute table that also
    pops open with information about that specie.
  <h6> Alvar Change interactivity:</h6>      
  <p> The chart in the lower left of the page can be interacted with so that when you click on a bar it displays the amount of 
  alvar cover for that given year and the total alvar in kilometer square is displayed when you hover over the bars for each year.</p>
