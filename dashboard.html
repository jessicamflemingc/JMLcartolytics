  <h1> How to use the dashboard </h1>
  <p> This dashboard has been created to highlight the primary results from the Landsat imagery classification and analysis within the Carden Alvar Natural Area. 
    Imagery was classified every 5 years between 1972 and 2022. Seven categories were used to classify imagery based on the resolution of the imagery (deciduous, 
    coniferous, emergent vegetation, open, wetland, water and industrial). Emergent vegetation would include shrubby, non forested areas. Open landcover would be pavement 
    alvars, bare ground or sparsely vegetated areas. The focus of this analysis was to determine losses and gains of open, pavement alvars within the Carden Alvar Natural Area. </p>
  <p> This map includes three full landcover classifications from 1972, 1997 and 2022 (60m resolution), the alvar gains and losses between each set of classified images and the 
    total alvar cover for each classification year. The map is fully adjustable where each feature can be resized by clicking and dragging the borders. Additionally, a feature can
    be made full screen by hovering over the right corner and clicking the expand button that appears. The navigation bar in the top right corner of the map includes the legend button, 
    the layer toggling button and the basemap switcher. To the right of the map is an interactive list of at risk species found on NCC properties. A species of interest can be searched
    for using the search bar at the top of the list. When a species is clicked the map will zoom into the location of the observation, flash around the point and bring up the species
    attribute table to display more information about the observation. The species and alvar change layers have pop-up functionality enabled, allowing the attribute table to be displayed
    for these features when clicked. The graph in the bottom of the map displays the total alvar (SQKM) for each classification year.  By hovering over the bar the total area is displayed. </p>
