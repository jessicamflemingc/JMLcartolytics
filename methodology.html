  <h4>Data Acquisition and Processing:</h4>
  <p>Created in ArcGIS Pro. It consisted of setting up the projection to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 17N and the default clipping extent to the study area created by jml cartolytics.  Reference data such as the carden alvar boundary, ecological land classification (ELC), protected areas which was clipped and queried to only show the ncc properties within the study area as well as some SCOOP imagery were provided from NCC. Open-source data was acquired from eBird and iNaturalist to display species in the area with a special interest of at-risk species. These were combined into one table and cleaned in Microsoft Access and then clipped to the ELC. Landsat imagery from USGS and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was also collected for every 5 years from 1972-2022 with the exception of 2012 which was replaced with 2013 imagery as 2012 had no usable imagery.  Please see figure 1 to see the reference data and species data. </p>

    <h4>Spatial Analysis:</h4>
    <p> Classifications for the Landsat imagery was performed in PCI Geomatics CATALYST with a supervised per-pixel 
 classification. The Supervised method was chosen because it was able to pick up on the variations in the landscape better than 
 unsupervised, please see figure 2. The classes created were industrial, emergent vegetation, bare ground, water, wetland, deciduous 
 forest and coniferous forest. Compute changes were then done in ArcGIS Pro between each chronological pair of imagery as well as
 one from start year to end year to display the changes in alvar composition through time. </p>

  <h4>Result:</h4>
  <p>The final geodatabase contains 2 feature datasets, 7 feature classes, 4 rasters, 2 joins on the clipped species data with the elc and ncc properties as well as metadata for the feature classes and rasters. Three of the rasters are the 1972, 1997, 2022 classifications and one of the rasters is the compute change from 1972-2022 that were used in the static map. Please see figure 3 to see the final contents that were included.</p>

    <p>Created in ArcGIS PRO and displays a side-by-side comparison of the 1972 and 2022 classifications with the 1972-2022 compute change overlain on the imagery to highlight the losses and gains of alvars through time. A table was included to show the changes in alvar composition for each year that was classified.</p>

      <h4>Interactive map</h4>
      <p> An interactive map was designed to highlight changes alvar composition through 
 time and the current species at risk in the Carden Alvar Area. It was decided that an AGOL (ArcGIS Online) Dashboard would be the best
 way to represent this. First, an AGOL webmap needed to be made to be used as the base for the Dashboard. This included inputting all the desired layers
and some formatting for the layers symbology. Then this webmap could be used in the Dashboard where further interactivity with the map could be enhanced. Please see the final solution page to see the final AGOL dashboard. </p>
