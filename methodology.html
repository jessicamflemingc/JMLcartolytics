  <h4>Data Acquisition and Processing:</h4>
  <p>Created in ArcGIS Pro. It consisted of setting up the projection to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 17N and the default clipping extent to the study area created by jml cartolytics.  Reference data such as the carden alvar boundary, ecological land classification (ELC), protected areas which was clipped and queried to only show the ncc properties within the study area as well as some SCOOP imagery were provided from NCC. Open-source data was acquired from eBird and iNaturalist to display species in the area with a special interest of at-risk species. These were combined into one table and cleaned in Microsoft Access and then clipped to the ELC. Landsat imagery from USGS and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was also collected for every 5 years from 1972-2022 with the exception of 2012 which was replaced with 2013 imagery as 2012 had no usable imagery.  Please see figure 1 to see the reference data and species data. </p>

    <h4>Spatial Analysis:</h4>
    <p> Classifications for the Landsat imagery was performed in PCI Geomatics CATALYST with a supervised per-pixel 
 classification. The classes created were industrial, emergent vegetation, bare ground, water, wetland, deciduous 
 forest and coniferous forest. Compute changes were then done in ArcGIS Pro between each chronological pair of imagery as well as
 one from start year to end year to display the changes in alvar composition through time. Figure 2 shows the process from raw to classified to compute changes.
    Map 1 is one of the landsat imagery that were downloaded from GEE and USGS every 5 years between 1972 and 2022. Map 2 and 3 are how each landsat
    image were classified in CATALYST. Map 4 is the compute change analysis completed to see the changes in landscape composition between each year. Map 5 
    is the total alvar cover extracted from the classifications. Map 6 is the total alvar loss and gain that was extracted.</p>

  <h4>Result:</h4>
  <p>The final geodatabase contains 2 feature datasets, 7 feature classes, 4 rasters, 2 joins on the clipped species data with the elc and ncc properties as well as metadata for the feature classes and rasters. Three of the rasters are the 1972, 1997, 2022 classifications and one of the rasters is the compute change from 1972-2022 that were used in the static map. Please see figure 3 to see the final contents that were included.</p>

  <h4> Simplify Classes</h4>
    <p>To
best visualize the results on the map and to focus on the open alvar changes, the deciduous and
coniferous forest classes were grouped together using ArcGIS Pro to that it was only one shade of green.
The Carden Alvar natural area is outlined in a dark grey and the NCC properties in a black to help them
stand out. There were no fills assigned to the boundaries because the classifications were to be visible.</p>

    <p>To produce a physical map that would print well and
be accessible to users, the Colour Brewer 2.0 “Color advice for cartography”
application was used with the print friendly option selected. The colour scheme
was chosen by selecting 4 classes and a qualitative theme to facilitate creating
visual differences between classes, see figure 4 for the colour HEX colour scheme that was selected.</p>

      <h4>Web Map</h4>
      <p> An interactive map was designed to highlight changes alvar composition through 
 time and the current species at risk in the Carden Alvar Area. It was decided that an AGOL (ArcGIS Online) Dashboard would be the best
 way to represent this. First, an AGOL webmap needed to be made to be used as the base for the Dashboard. This included inputting all the desired layers
and some formatting for the layers symbology. Then this webmap could be used in the Dashboard where further interactivity with the map could be enhanced. Please see the final solution page to see the final AGOL dashboard. </p>
